                <h1>Chris Cardus</h1>
                <p>I am currently studying towards a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. My course also includes a year in industry during the third year. I am in the first year at the moment and I am currently looking for a summer internship. I want to work over the summer so that I can supplement and improve the skills that I have learned during my first year of university.</p>
                <p>This website contains my digital CV as well as a sample of the programming work that I have done and the programs that I have created. If you would like to contact me, please find my contact details on my <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/chriscardus" target="_blank"><b>LinkedIn profile page</b></a>.</p>
